    <h3>Flex row and columns</h3>
   <p> flex-row to set a horizontal direction in a row manner<br>
    whereas flex-column to set a vertical direction<br>

    and flex column reverse to set a vertical direction from opposite side<br>
    <h3>Inline ,Internal and External CSS</h3>
    <P>Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element.<br>
       For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.<br>
       You can easily and quickly insert CSS rules to an HTML page.<br><br>
       Internal CSS requires you to add style tag in the head section of your HTML document.<br>
       This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page.<br>
       You can use class and ID selectors in this style sheet.<br><br>
        External CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file<br>
        CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website.<br>
         By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.

<h3>JUSTIFY CONTENT</h3>
<P>Justify content is used to align the items of the flexible box container when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally). <br>
    It defines how the browser distributes the space around and between the content items.</P>
    <h3>RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE POSITIONING</h3>
    <p>An element with position relative is positioned to its normal position<br>
    We can change the place of an element from the place where it is starting<br><br>
    The absolute positioning is used to position an element relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static.<br>
    With the absolute positioning, you can place an element anywhere on a page.<br></p>
    <h3>GRID TEMPLATE COLUMNS</h3>
    <p>IT is basically css grid property<br>
        Grid template column is used to specify the size of the columns.</p>
        <h3>Z-INDEX</h3>
        <P>Z-index is used to specify the stacking order of the positioned elements (elements whose position value is either fixed, absolute, relative, or sticky).<br>
            It defines the element's order if they overlap each other.<br>
            We can give postive and negative values.</P>
<h3>PADDING AND MARGIN</h3>
<p>Margin: It is the space around an element. Margins are used to move an element up or down on a page as well as left or right. <br>
    Margin is completely transparent, and it does not have any background color.<br><br>
    Padding: It is the space between the element and the related content inside it.<br>
    IT shows the container background around the element in it.
